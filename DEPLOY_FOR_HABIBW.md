## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Problem:** "Repository already exists"
- Solution: Use a different name like `quant-geography-stats-2024`

**Problem:** "404 error when visiting URL"
- Solution: Wait 3-5 minutes, then refresh. GitHub Pages takes time to activate.

**Problem:** "Upload failed"
- Solution: Refresh the page and try again. Check your internet connection.

**Problem:** "Pages option not showing"
- Solution: Make sure the repository is set to "Public", not "Private"
